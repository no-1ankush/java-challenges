# Duplicate Number in Array

## Problem Statement: ##

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Note:**

* You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
* You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
* Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
* There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## Sample Input/Output: ##

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Scenario # </th>
            <th>Input</th>
            <th>Output</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>[1, 3, 4, 2, 2]</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>[3, 2, 5, 14, 5, 5, 19, 18, 11, 10, 1, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 12, 5, 17, 5]</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
