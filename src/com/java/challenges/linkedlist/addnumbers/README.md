# Add Two Linked List

## Problem Statement: ##

Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

            <th colspan="2">Input</th>
            <th rowspan="2">Output</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Linked List 1</th>
            <th>Linked List 2</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>[2,4,3]</td>
            <td>[5,4,3]</td>
            <td>[7,8,6]</td>
        </tr>
